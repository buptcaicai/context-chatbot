# Context-Aware Chatbot Demo

This project demonstrates a context-aware chatbot built using **Kafka**, **LangChain**, **Qdrant**, **FastAPI**, and **ReactJS**. It features two microservices:

- **Document Ingestion Service**: Processes and stores documents for contextual understanding.
- **LLM RAG Chat Service**: Handles chat interactions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on Kafka message streams.

The demo showcases a scalable, message-driven architecture for building intelligent, context-aware conversational systems.
It contains both kafka and SNS+SQS implementation.
